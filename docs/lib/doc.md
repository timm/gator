# [./lib/doc.lisp](/src/./lib/doc.lisp)

##  My simple documenter

Convert lisp code to markdown.  Strings are printed
verbatim.  defuns, defmacros, defmethods, defclass,
defstructs get their doco string pulled, then topped with a
&lt;h3> heading. And a table of contents is added to the top of
page.

Usage: 

    cat file.lisp | lisp doc.lisp

The system is controlled by two variables:

- The `want` variable.
  An entry (e.g.) `(defun . 3)` says that we will display lists
  starting with `defun` if it has a doc string as element `3`
  (which means the fourth thing in the list).
- The `fmt` variable which controls how we render something's
  name and doc string.
